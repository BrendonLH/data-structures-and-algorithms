# Array-Reverse
# Array Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I Found an algorithm that finds the middle of the array , checks to see if it matches the key then based on that value, resets the high and low points. after it reruns the whole thing.

- I understand all the parts of the function now which I am happy with. I just need to learn how to program it myself. I understand what everything is doing, I am at the point where I need to be able to remember what I need to do, and then code it in my own way. Im starting to find ways that make sense to me.

- i FINALLY GOT MY TEST TO RUN! after 3 hours I got it to work so now its all good!
