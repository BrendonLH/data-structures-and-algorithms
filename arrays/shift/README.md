- Write a function called insertShiftArray that takes array values and inserts new value at the middle of array. Do not use any built in methods. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I decided to split the array and insert the new num after the middle part. Im not sure what the big O is for both.

## Notes

- took me alot more time than I would have liked. I had to have alot of help from others as, I couldnt wrap my head around parts of the function. I dont like implementing code i dont understand so I had alot of help. It works and I understand what it is doing now and I also learned how to use the debugger tool in vs code.
